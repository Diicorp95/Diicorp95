[Erwin Schrödinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger) said:
>Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) the company [wrote](https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-revenue-model/):
>This is why if you search for something on Google, you may start seeing ads for it everywhere. Using the Internet doesn’t have to feel like you’re being watched, listened to, and monitored.
